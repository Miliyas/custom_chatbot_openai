Create a new virtual environment using the Python Launcher:
​

`python3.10 -m venv myenv`


Note: Replace myenv with your desired virtual environment name.
​

Activate the virtual environment:
​

`source myenv/bin/activate`


Install the project requirements using pip:
​

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
​


​

By specifying the version using py -3.8 or python3.10, you can ensure that the virtual environment is created using Python 3.10.14 specifically, even if you have other Python versions installed.
​
​

Then you can run the notebook or use the command to run the app:

`streamlit run main.py`
